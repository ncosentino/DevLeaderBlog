        <h2>What Is Dev Leader Weekly Newsletter?</h2>
        <p>This is my <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://weekly.devleader.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FREE newsletter</a></strong></span> that I send out every Saturday morning directly to your inbox! I try to include the following in every issue, and I hope to keep evolving the content format so that it keeps you engaged:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A newsletter-exclusive article focused on general software engineering or a programming example with code</li>
            <li>Early access to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@@devleader?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube videos</a></strong></span> before they launch</li>
            <li>Review of content shared throughout the week</li>
            <li>Sneak previews of upcoming things I’m working on before they launch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Did You Say The Newsletter is Free?</h2>
        <p>That’s right! I do my absolute best to release as much high-quality free educational content as I possibly can. My standard newsletter will always remain free because I want to ensure I can share my experiences directly with you with no barriers.</p>
